Data Set Info:

The expirement used a group of 30 volunteers in the 19 - 48 cohort. 

Each volunteer performed 6 acivities: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying

The accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy S 2, captured the 3 - axial linear axxeleration and 3 - axial angular velocity at 50hz.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.









Attirbute Information:
For each record in the data set the following is recorded.
    1. Traxial accelerationg from the accelerometer and estimated body acceleration
    2. Traxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope
    3. A 561 - feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. its activity            label. An indentifier of the volunteer.
